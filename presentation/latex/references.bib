abstract = {Hist{\'{o}}ricamente el bosque tropical se ha visualizado como una selva densa, con palmas y {\'{a}}rboles altos donde abundan las ep{\'{i}}fitas, los helechos y las enredaderas, con un sotobosque oscuro y h{\'{u}}medo, donde pululan los murci{\'{e}}lagos, las aves, los reptiles y las mariposas de todos los colores. Sin embargo, esta visi{\'{o}}n no corresponde con todos los tipos de bosque tropical. De hecho el bioma “bosque tropical” abarca desde los bosques de niebla montanos hasta los matorrales cerrados subxerof{\'{i}}ticos de los desiertos en tierras bajas. Notoriamente, dentro de estos est{\'{a}} el bosque seco tropical (BST), originalmente uno de los m{\'{a}}s extensos en nuestro pa{\'{i}}s, ya que cubr{\'{i}}a gran parte de los valles geogr{\'{a}}ficos de los r{\'{i}}os Cauca y Magdalena, la Costa Caribe, y los Llanos Orientales; hoy a punto de desaparecer. A diferencia de su hom{\'{o}}logo h{\'{u}}medo, en este bosque abundan las lianas, los cactus, los reptiles y los insectos gigantes; su dosel abierto se queda sin hojas en la {\'{e}}poca seca y explota con flores de todos los colores apenas empiezan las primeras lluvias. El bosque seco tropical est{\'{a}} restringido a las tierras bajas desde M{\'{e}}xico hasta Bolivia y Brasil donde existe una fuerte estacionalidad de lluvias marcada por una {\'{e}}poca seca (menos de 100 mm de lluvia) de 4 a 6 meses al a{\~{n}}o. Esta estacionalidad ha resultado en una serie de adaptaciones morfol{\'{o}}gicas, fisiol{\'{o}}gicas y de comportamiento en plantas, animales y microorganismos, para los cuales vivir en el bosque seco representa un reto. As{\'{i}} mismo, la combinaci{\'{o}}n de esta estacionalidad clim{\'{a}}tica y la actividad de los organismos que lo habitan determinan los procesos y servicios que les presta a millones de personas que dependen directa o indirectamente de este ecosistema. De particular importancia son la estabilizaci{\'{o}}n de los suelos, el ciclaje de nutrientes, la regulaci{\'{o}}n h{\'{i}}drica y clim{\'{a}}tica, y la provisi{\'{o}}n de alimentos y madera. El suministro de estos servicios depende del delicado balance entre uso y abuso de los ecosistemas, que adem{\'{a}}s determina la prevenci{\'{o}}n de la desertificaci{\'{o}}n, la cual representa la principal amenaza para los ecosistema secos de todo el planeta. De hecho en este libro se reporta que m{\'{a}}s de la mitad del {\'{a}}rea que estaba cubierta originalmente por BST en nuestro pa{\'{i}}s se ha degradado hasta el punto de la desertificaci{\'{o}}n. Esto prueba la fragilidad de este tipo de bosque y la urgente necesidad de conservar lo poco que queda y de restaurarlo en las zonas degradadas de donde ha desaparecido.},

abstract = {In the tropics and subtropics, most fires are set by humans for a wide range of purposes. The total amount of burned area and fire emissions reflects a complex interaction between climate, human activities, and ecosystem processes. Here we used satellite-derived data sets of active fire detections, burned area, precipitation, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) during 1998–2006 to investigate this interaction. The total number of active fire detections and burned area was highest in areas that had intermediate levels of both net primary production (NPP; 500–1000 g C m−2 year−1) and precipitation (1000–2000 mm year−1), with limits imposed by the length of the fire season in wetter ecosystems and by fuel availability in drier ecosystems. For wet tropical forest ecosystems we developed a metric called the fire-driven deforestation potential (FDP) that integrated information about the length and intensity of the dry season. FDP partly explained the spatial and interannual pattern of fire-driven deforestation across tropical forest regions. This climate-fire link in combination with higher precipitation rates in the interior of the Amazon suggests that a negative feedback on fire-driven deforestation may exist as the deforestation front moves inward. In Africa, compared to the Amazon, a smaller fraction of the tropical forest area had FDP values sufficiently low to prevent fire use. Tropical forests in mainland Asia were highly vulnerable to fire, whereas forest areas in equatorial Asia had, on average, the lowest FDP values. FDP and active fire detections substantially increased in forests of equatorial Asia, however, during El Ni{\~{n}}o periods. In contrast to these wet ecosystems we found a positive relationship between precipitation, fAPAR, NPP, and active fire detections in arid ecosystems. This relationship was strongest in northern Australia and arid regions in Africa. Highest levels of fire activity were observed in savanna ecosystems that were limited neither by fuel nor by the length of the fire season. However, relations between annual precipitation or drought extent and active fire detections were often poor here, hinting at the important role of other factors, including land managers, in controlling spatial and temporal variability of fire.},

These regions are home to dry forests and savannas (Figures 1 and 2), and are the focus of this Primer. The attention given to rain forests is understandable. Their high species diversity, sheer stature and luxuriance thrill biologists today as much as they did the first explorers in the Age of Discovery. Although dry forest and savanna may make less of a first impression, they support a fascinating diversity of plant strategies to cope with stress and disturbance including fire, drought and herbivory. Savannas played a fundamental role in human evolution, and across Africa and India they support iconic megafauna.

abstract = {Tropical moist forests and savannas are iconic biomes. There is, however, a third principal biome in the lowland tropics that is less well known: tropical dry forest. Discussions on responses of vegetation in the tropics to climate and land-use change often focus on shifts between forests and savannas, but ignore dry forests. Tropical dry forests are distinct from moist forests in their seasonal drought stress and consequent deciduousness and differ from savannas in rarely experiencing fire. These factors lead tropical dry forests to have unique ecosystem function. Here, we discuss the underlying environmental drivers of transitions among tropical dry forests, moist forests and savannas, and demonstrate how incorporating tropical dry forests into our understanding of tropical biome transitions is critical to understanding the future of tropical vegetation under global environmental change.},

abstract = {Aim: To analyse the conservation status of tropical dry forests at the global scale, by combining a newly developed global distribution map with spatial data describing different threats, and to identify the relative exposure of different forest areas to such threats. Location: Global assessment. Methods: We present a new global distribution map of tropical dry forest derived from the recently developed MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product, which depicts percentage tree cover at a resolution of 500 m, combined with previously defined maps of biomes. This distribution map was overlaid with spatial data to estimate the exposure of tropical dry forests to a number of different threats: climate change, habitat fragmentation, fire, human population density and conversion to cropland. The extent of tropical dry forest currently protected was estimated by overlaying the forest map with a global data set of the distribution of protected areas. Results: It is estimated that 1,048,700 km(2) of tropical dry forest remains, distributed throughout the three tropical regions. More than half of the forest area (54.2{\%}) is located within South America, the remaining area being almost equally divided between North and Central America, Africa and Eurasia, with a relatively small proportion (3.8{\%}) occurring within Australasia and Southeast Asia. Overall, c. 97{\%} of the remaining area of tropical dry forest is at risk from one or more of the threats considered, with highest percentages recorded for Eurasia. The relative exposure to different threats differed between regions: while climate change is relatively significant in the Americas, habitat fragmentation and fire affect a higher proportion of African forests, whereas agricultural conversion and human population density are most influential in Eurasia. Evidence suggests that c. 300,000 km(2) of tropical dry forest now coincide with some form of protected area, with 71.8{\%} of this total being located within South America. Main conclusions: Virtually all of the tropical dry forests that remain are currently exposed to a variety of different threats, largely resulting from human activity. Taking their high biodiversity value into consideration, this indicates that tropical dry forests should be accorded high conservation priority. The results presented here could be used to identify which forest areas should be accorded highest priority for conservation action. In particular, the expansion of the global protected area network, particularly in Mesoamerica, should be given urgent consideration},

@article{Bowman2011,
abstract = {Humans and their ancestors are unique in being a fire-making species, but ‘natural' (i.e. independent of humans) fires have an ancient, geological history on Earth. Natural fires have influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes. Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused a departure from ‘natural' background levels that vary with climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants, altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires, thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life, and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects, and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in global vegetation and climate change models. We provide an historical framework to promote understanding of the development and diversification of fire regimes, covering the pre-human period, human domestication of fire, and the subsequent transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies. All of these phases still occur on Earth, providing opportunities for comparative research.},
